First, install pip if you haven't done so already:
On Windows, run:
    py -3 get_pip.py

To check if pip is installed correctly, in the Python shell:
    import pip
If installed correctly, there should be no error.

Then, make sure to install all module requirements:
    py -3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
